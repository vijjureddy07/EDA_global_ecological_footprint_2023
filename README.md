About the Dataset
Context

The Ecological Footprint of Consumption quantifies the ecological resources required by a population to produce the natural resources it consumes. This includes plant-based foods, fiber products, livestock and fish products, timber, and other forest products, as well as the space needed for urban infrastructure. Additionally, it measures the ability to absorb waste, particularly carbon emissions. The footprint encompasses six categories of productive surface areas: cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up (urban) land, forest area, and land for carbon sequestration.

A nation's biocapacity indicates the productivity of its ecological assets. These assets include cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land. When left unharvested, these areas can also play a significant role in absorbing the waste generated, especially carbon emissions.
