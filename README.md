About the Dataset
Context

The Ecological Footprint of Consumption quantifies the ecological resources required by a population to produce the natural resources it consumes. This includes plant-based foods, fiber products, livestock and fish products, timber, and other forest products, as well as the space needed for urban infrastructure. Additionally, it measures the ability to absorb waste, particularly carbon emissions. The footprint encompasses six categories of productive surface areas: cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up (urban) land, forest area, and land for carbon sequestration.

A nation's biocapacity indicates the productivity of its ecological assets. These assets include cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land. When left unharvested, these areas can also play a significant role in absorbing the waste generated, especially carbon emissions.

Data summary
Here's a breakdown of each column in the provided data:

Country: Name of the country.
Region: Geographic region to which the country belongs.
SDGi: Sustainable Development Goals index.
Life Expectancy: Average life expectancy in years.
HDI: Human Development Index, a composite index measuring life expectancy, education, and per capita income.
Per Capita GDP: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
Income Group: Income group classification (e.g., LI for Low Income, UM for Upper Middle Income).
Population (millions): Population of the country in millions.
Cropland Footprint: Ecological footprint of cropland activities, measured in global hectares per person.
Grazing Footprint: Ecological footprint of grazing activities, measured in global hectares per person.
Forest Product Footprint: Ecological footprint of forest product activities, measured in global hectares per person.
Carbon Footprint: Ecological footprint of carbon emissions, measured in global hectares per person.
Fish Footprint: Ecological footprint of fish consumption, measured in global hectares per person.
Built-up land: Ecological footprint of built-up land, measured in global hectares per person.
Total Ecological Footprint (Consumption): Total ecological footprint of consumption, measured in global hectares per person.
Cropland: Biocapacity of cropland, measured in global hectares per person.
Grazing land: Biocapacity of grazing land, measured in global hectares per person.
Forest land: Biocapacity of forest land, measured in global hectares per person.
Fishing ground: Biocapacity of fishing ground, measured in global hectares per person.
Built-up land: Biocapacity of built-up land, measured in global hectares per person.
Total biocapacity: Total biocapacity, measured in global hectares per person.
Ecological (Deficit) or Reserve: The difference between total ecological footprint and total biocapacity, indicating whether the country has an ecological deficit (negative value) or reserve (positive value).
Number of Earths required: The number of Earths that would be required if everyone lived like the average person in the country.
Number of Countries required: The number of countries with the same biocapacity that would be required if everyone lived like the average person in the country.
